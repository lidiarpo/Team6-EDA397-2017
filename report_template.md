# Project Description
An application that allows users to subscribe to specific flights, providing flight information (e.g. delays, cancellation, early arrival) via push notifications.

The app will show all the flights from, and to, Gothenburg Landvetter Airport (GOT). Later on the user will be able to choose among other airports in Sweden and then we can might expand to the rest of the world depending on public interest. The user can filter the departures/arrivals and subscribe to some flight of concern. The user can filter to many flights. The user can choose (in settings) or in each flight what kind of notification he/she wants to receive about that flight.

# Sprint Log
Write one log per sprint.

## Commitment
List the features/stories the team commits to finish during the sprint.

## Work Done
Log what was accomplished, and how.

Feature | Commits  | Group members | Effort | Practices
----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------
Name and ID of each feature | Sha1 for the commit(s) that make up the feature | Names of the group members who developed the feature | The development effort expended, in story points or other unit of choice | The agile practices practiced when developing the feature


## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

For each practice practiced:

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How efficient was the practice, given the time it took to use?



# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.

- For each practice, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?

- Outcome, screenshots or similar.

## Administrative details

- Send in the sprint reports and postmortem report via mail
  to Terese and Magnus. Deadlines are in the course schedule.

- The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.
