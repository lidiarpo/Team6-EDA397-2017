# Project Description
An application that allows users to subscribe to specific flights, providing flight information (e.g. delays, cancellation, early arrival) via push notifications.

The app will show all the flights from, and to, Gothenburg Landvetter Airport (GOT). Later on the user will be able to choose among other airports in Sweden and then we can might expand to the rest of the world depending on public interest. The user can filter the departures/arrivals and subscribe to some flight of concern. The user can filter to many flights. The user can choose (in settings) or in each flight what kind of notification he/she wants to receive about that flight.

# Sprint Log
## Sprint 1:
We started the sprint by populating the backlog of stories written as issues in git. Next we had to estimate the issues by giving them story points that would indicate their complexity, in our wiki the explanation of how we map our story point metric to complexity for the estimation of each issue can be read. We used a a well known estimation technque to estimate our backlog the Planning Poker. For the Planning Poker we used a online servie Plan IT Poker (http://www.planitpoker.com/) so every member of the group could remotely vote. After the results of the voting we reasoned together to come to a estimation conclustion that everybody agreed on. When every issue had an estimation, we had to plan how many issues we were going to commit to for the first acceptance test.  Based on the time capacity each member should contribute per week and the issues that had the most priority we decided to commit to 6 issues in Sprint 1. 

## Commitment
List the features/stories the team commits to finish during the sprint.
### Sprint 1 Commitment:
In the parathesis the estimation point of each issue, followed by the issue number.
1. Create a hello world application (3) #5
2. Travis CI setup (5) #26
3. Investigate appropriate API for flight retrieval (3) #3
4. Retrieve flight information from public API (5) #22
5. Parse flight information (programmatic representation of flight data) (5) #18
6. Present flight data (5) #13

## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

For each practice practiced:

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How efficient was the practice, given the time it took to use?

### Sprint 1:


# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.

- For each practice, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?

- Outcome, screenshots or similar.

## Administrative details

- Send in the sprint reports and postmortem report via mail
  to Terese and Magnus. Deadlines are in the course schedule.

- The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.
